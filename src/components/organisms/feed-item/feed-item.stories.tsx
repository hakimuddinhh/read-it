  selftext_html: "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about posting this for a while, but haven&amp;#39;t really had the courage to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s been many posts throughout the years wondering where all the posts from normal people and/or blue collars are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well - here is one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I don&amp;#39;t write particularly well, I&amp;#39;m just very matter-of-fact).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to a vocational high school and enrolled in Plumbing / Pipefitting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I graduated in 2007 in a dead economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was unable to find work as an apprentice, but eventually found work at a local plastics manufacturing company in the tool &amp;amp; die shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was paid $11/hr as an apprentice to mold makers and to do facility maintenance work for the shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worked 10 hours Monday - Friday, and a half day Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was entitled to 401K and tutition reimbursement (with no payback requirement or term of service).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matching contributions were frozen until the economy started to pick up, but I contributed as much as I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ESOP company, so I got profit sharing (based on my salary) every quarter, which I never spent and put into a separate account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These amounted to 4 additional paychecks every year (if we did well).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I enrolled in a community college which had an Engineering transfer program. I had to take a lot of remedial math courses to get up to speed because of my High School program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took advantage of tuition reimbursement, and then took the reimbursements and put them into a Roth or Brokerage at the end of each semester.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remained at home and paid my mother $300/mo for my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drove a car I bought for $4000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll get blasted for living at home, I&amp;#39;m sure, but it was mutually beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was raised by a single mother who worked 60 hour weeks to keep a roof over our heads (I have a brother).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no inconvenience. Working the hours I was working and going to school part time meant I basically needed a bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I wasn&amp;#39;t at work, I was in the library, in class or sleeping. I did take a couple vacations/trips during this time during school breaks, but they were not extravagant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned to be very efficient with my time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left this job in 2012 making $13.25.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I joined a field service company maintaining specialized industrial equipment as a greenhorn for $17/hr (I was 23). This came with a company vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I traveled all over New England and am based from my home address.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The majority of our work is in greater Boston, which meant I was home everyday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finished my Associates Degree program in engineering in 2014, and was given a pay raise to $25.00.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this time, I moved out (25). I lived with a girlfriend for a while (split costs), with a friend for a bit, and then eventually got my own apartment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Community College had transfer agreements with some private colleges and the state university system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was accepted into a few for Mechanical Engineering, but it didn&amp;#39;t really seem to justify leaving my job over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I enrolled in a night program for Engineering Technology at the state university.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;401K (6% matching), and tuition reimbursement strategy remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I completed my Bachelor&amp;#39;s in 2019, and was bumped to $34/hr.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I currently remain with this company and was recently given a raise to $43/hr and primarily work on projects and technician development. I remain in the field and get my hands dirty on a regular basis, and no, my body isn&amp;#39;t beat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work anywhere from 28-60 hours a week depending on the season, but am guaranteed 40 hours of pay per week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I kept more data, but the strategy that worked the most for me was just saving whatever extra money I got and then putting whatever raise I got straight into my 401k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I didn&amp;#39;t have it, I didn&amp;#39;t miss it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of every month I took whatever was left in my checking account and transferred it into my brokerage account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still living on around $35-40K a year, but I&amp;#39;ll treat myself - I just don&amp;#39;t require much. I&amp;#39;m super minimalistic, but a couple of years ago I bought a personal vehicle, not important but it&amp;#39;s a totally unnecessary expense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently single and 32 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Balances:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;401k - $238k (target date funds)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roth - $77K&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brokerage - $92K&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plain old cash - $25K&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total: $432K&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This past year my mother passed away, so I just recently moved back into her condo which was about 2/3 paid off (approx 180k, which I&amp;#39;d be entitled to half, but for now my brother and I are going to keep it). She left no debt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I guess I&amp;#39;m over $500k, but I&amp;#39;m not really counting the condo as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feeling pretty good heading into the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk, you can do it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
